# DevOps-Learning--Docker
A collection of my Docker notes covering all the key concepts and essential commands needed to work with containers.

This repository also includes hands-on examples that demonstrate the full Docker workflow.

These examples will be linked in the **Docker assignment** and walk through the following stages:
- Setting up a web application locally
- Containerizing the application
- Adding additional containers (e.g., databases) manually
- Scaling up to Docker Compose for multi-container management

Throughout the examples, Iâ€™ve included explanations of the advantages, use cases, and key features of each step â€” helping to build a clear understanding of how Docker works in real-world development.

# ðŸ§ª DevOps Learning â€“ Docker Module

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Linux. It contains:
- âœ… [Docker Notes](./docker-notes/notes.md) â€“ Practical tips, command references.
- âœ… (Docker Assignments)(links coming soon) â€“ Step-by-step examples and workflows using Docker to containerize and manage applications.


Each section is a self-contained learning log designed to strengthen my Docker skills through hands-on problem-solving and exploration.
